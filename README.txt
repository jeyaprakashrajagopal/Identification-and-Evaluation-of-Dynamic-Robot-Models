Identification and Evaluation of Dynamic Robot Models

All the packages used in this project are explained here:
---------------------------------------------------------

1. mir_teleop related pkg's : this package is used to change the start state of the robot 
		since moveit read the joint state and it is out of limits when
		the manipulator is in the home position.
		 

My own packages and implementation
-----------------------------------
2. youbot_moveit_config     : This package is created in moveit to plan the trajectories
			     
3. models_evaluation	    : This is the actual implementation of this project for 
			      both the identification and evaluation of the models
